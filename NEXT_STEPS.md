# Next Steps for Pub Digital Signage Project

## Project Status Overview
The Pub Digital Signage project currently has the foundational structure defined with some initial file organization for both frontend (Vue.js) and backend (Node.js with Express). We have comprehensive documentation on architecture, implementation plans, database schema, and Home Assistant integration. The project directory structure has been established, with placeholder files for key components, but active development needs to begin following the phased approach outlined in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.

## Current Progress
- ✅ Project documentation and planning complete
- ❌ Basic directory structure established
- ❌ Initial API controller and routes files created (but need implementation)
- ❌ Initial Vue.js components created (but need implementation)
- ❌ Database implementation not started
- ❌ Core functionality not implemented
- ❌ Integration with external services not started

## Immediate Tasks (Next 2 Weeks)

### 1. Technology Stack Finalization
- **Backend**: Confirm Node.js/Express (currently set in docker-compose.yml)
- **Frontend**: Confirm Vue.js (current directory structure suggests this)
- **Database**: Set up SQLite as specified in DATABASE_SCHEMA.md
- **File Storage**: Create directory structure for media assets under /data following PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md

### 2. Development Environment Setup
- Create the missing docs/setup/installation.md for detailed deployment instructions
- Ensure docker-compose.yml is working correctly for development
  - Test running `docker-compose up` and verify containers start properly
  - Add any missing services (e.g., database)
- Set up linting and formatting rules (ESLint + Prettier recommended)
  - Add configuration files to both frontend and backend directories
- Configure testing framework (Jest recommended)
  - Set up unit testing for backend controllers
  - Set up component testing for Vue frontend
- Create git workflow (branching strategy, PR template)
  - Add .github/ directory with PR template and workflow definitions

### 3. Database Implementation
- Create SQLite database using schema in DATABASE_SCHEMA.md
- Implement database connection in backend
  - Add Sequelize ORM or similar to package.json
  - Set up models for drinks, games, visitors tables

  - Add swagger.json or use swagger-jsdoc for annotation-based docs

### 5. Frontend Foundation
- Set up Vue Router (already started in src/frontend/router/index.js)
  - Define routes for all views
  - Implement route guards for admin routes
- Set up Vuex store (already started in src/frontend/store/index.js)
  - Create modules for drinks, games, visitors, and config
  - Implement actions, mutations, and getters
- Create component hierarchy
  - Define reusable UI components
  - Implement layout components
- Implement responsive layout framework
  - Use CSS Grid/Flexbox for responsive design
  - Ensure compatibility with Raspberry Pi display dimensions
- Create theme system (day/night and seasonal variants)
  - Define theme variables and CSS custom properties
  - Implement theme switching mechanism

## Phase 1 Deliverables
