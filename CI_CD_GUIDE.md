# CI/CD Pipeline Guide for Pub Digital Signage

## What is a CI/CD Pipeline?

CI/CD stands for **Continuous Integration** and **Continuous Deployment**. It's a method to frequently deliver apps to customers by introducing automation into the application development process. In simple terms:

1. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Automatically testing your code changes to make sure they work correctly
2. **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: Automatically deploying your approved code changes to your Raspberry Pi

## How It Will Help Your Pub Digital Signage

For your pub digital signage project, a CI/CD pipeline will:

1. Make it easy to test changes on your Mac before they go to the Raspberry Pi
2. Automatically transfer approved changes to your Raspberry Pi
3. Ensure your digital sign is updated without manually copying files
4. Help maintain a stable, working system

## Simple CI/CD Pipeline for This Project

We'll set up a straightforward pipeline using GitHub Actions (or a similar service) that will:

1. Detect when you push changes to your GitHub repository
2. Run automated tests to ensure everything works
3. If tests pass, automatically deploy the changes to your Raspberry Pi

## Components We'll Set Up

1. **GitHub Repository**: To store your code and track changes
2. **Testing Scripts**: Simple tests to ensure components work correctly
3. **Deployment Scripts**: Scripts that will copy your code to the Raspberry Pi
4. **SSH Configuration**: Secure connection between GitHub and your Raspberry Pi

## Step-by-Step Setup

We'll implement this in phases:

1. First, we'll set up manual deployment so you can understand the process
2. Then, we'll automate testing to ensure your changes work
3. Finally, we'll automate deployment so changes are automatically pushed to your Raspberry Pi

## Benefits for a Home Project

Even for a small home project, CI/CD provides significant benefits:

1. **Consistency**: Your Raspberry Pi always runs the latest working version
2. **Simplicity**: Update your digital sign by just pushing code changes
3. **Peace of Mind**: Automatic tests help catch problems before they reach your pub display
4. **Learning**: Great way to learn modern development practices

We'll implement this step-by-step as the project progresses, ensuring you understand each part of the process.
